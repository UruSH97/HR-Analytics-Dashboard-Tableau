# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Tableau

## About

An interactive HR analytics dashboard created in Tableau to help organizations make data-driven decisions around employee demographics, salary distributions, performance, and departmental structures. It offers an executive overview and a drill-down employee-level view, enabling stakeholders to identify hiring trends, performance gaps, and salary disparities.

## Problem Statement

HR teams often manage large volumes of employee data but lack a centralized, intuitive way to gain actionable insights. Raw data across spreadsheets makes it hard to analyze retention, performance, and compensation trends effectively.

This project solves that by transforming raw HR data into a dynamic and filterable Tableau dashboard. It empowers managers to explore key HR metrics visually—such as tenure, salary by education, departmental hiring trends, and age-performance clusters—leading to informed workforce planning and better business outcomes.

## Deliverables

- Employee Details Dashboard: A searchable/filterable table with complete employee-level info (age, role, salary, geography, employment length)  
- Location Heatmap: Visual summary of branch-level hiring  
- Performance Insights: Correlation between age, performance, education, and salary  
- Salary Distribution Visuals: By gender, education level, and role  
- Tenure Tracker: Visual bars indicating years of employment for each staff member  
- Clean Design & Filters: Dark theme, interactive filters by department, gender, hire date, and more
